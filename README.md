# Java-CSV-Reader-and-Statistical-Analysis
A common format for storing tabular data (any data organized into columns and rows) is in comma separated values (CSV) files. This program lets you analyze and manipulate data from multiple CSV data files using a powerful open-source software package: Apache Commons CSV.
Analyze CSV data across multiple CSV files (for example, find maximums, minimums, averages, and other simple statistical results). Parse through multiple CSV files containing more than hundred thousand rows.
